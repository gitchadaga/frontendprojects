Including mini projects for learning front end web development from zero.

Hello, this repo is for storing my projects on learning front end web dev in my late 20s. I don't know if career switching is a good idea at this moment but trying is better than just dreaming.
If you want to review or comment on my project, feel free. Also in this repo I might use some AI helps so please let me know how to improve my projects.
Thanks.
